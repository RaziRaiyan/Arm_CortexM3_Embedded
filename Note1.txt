1. Is it true that , system Bus is not connected to Flash memory??

--> True, Check Embedded Flash memory interface in refernce manual

2. Processor can fetch instructions from SRAM over i-code BUS T/F??
--> False(There are advance technique from which we can do this).

3. System Bus can operate at speed upto 180MHz??
--> True

4. SRAMs are connected to system BUS T/F?
--> True , Check Block Diagram.

5. APB1 BUS can operate at speed upto 180MHz?
--> False, it can only run upto 45MHz.

6.Let's say i have a peripheral whose datasheet says that, its operating frequency or speed must be above
95MHz, can i connect that peripheral via APB2 BUS??
--> APB2  BUS runs at max speed of 90 MHZ, Hence it is not possible.


7. Processor can fetch instructions as well as simulaneously from SRAM T/F??
--> FALSE,

8. Processor can fetch instructions as well as simulaneously from FLASH T/F??
--> True, cuz it has separate BUS called I_CODE and D_CODE

9.What is the Max. HCLK(AHB1 BUS) clock value of your MCU??
--> 180MHz 


10. What is the MAX PCLK(APB1 BUS) value of your MCU?
--> 90MHz
 
11. GPIOs and processor communicate over AHB1  BUS T/F?
--> TRUE

12. USB OTG and processor communicate over AHB2 BUS T/F?
--> TRUE

13. USB OTG and GPIOs can communicate to processor simulaneously ??
--> FALSE, both finally connects to system BUS. BUS matrix won't allow that.

14. Processor can talk to flash memory and SRAM simulaneously ?
--> TRUE, Both connects to different BUSes.
